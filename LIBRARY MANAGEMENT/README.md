 # ***Library Management Service***   

 ## About   
It helps us keep databases of different users and books. New users can register themselves by giving their Full Name, Date of Birth [DOB], Aadhar Number, Contact Number, Username, Password and Gender. They need to keep a note of their username and password for future reference.

Registered users can issue books by giving their Full Name, Name of the Book, Author's Name, Date of Birth [DOB], Date of Issue, Card Number, Username and Password. He can also return the book in the same way.
